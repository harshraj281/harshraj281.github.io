      <h3>Who are we?</h3>
      <p>We are a bunch of passionate photographers who yearn for great stories. Let us know your story and we
        will create a custom package for you. We believe in photographing every life event and moment as it
        truly happens- from the gentle happy tear streaming down your face to the little embraces to the big
        elaborate dances and fireworks - everything captured and remembered.
      </p>

      <h3>What is our approach?</h3>
      <p>We have a modern approach towards photography but we still understand the importance of vintage vibes.
        Our goal is to blend in with the day, so you never feel like you have a camera stuck in your face.
        We capture the raw, unscripted moments that make your day unique - the laughs, the
        tears, the quiet moments of reflection. By doing so, we strive to create a visual story that reflects
        the essence of who you are. So when you view your images, you'll not only see the beauty of
        the day, but you'll remember exactly how it felt.</p>

      <h3>Do we travel?</h3>
      <p>Yes, we do travel all across the world.</p>

      <h3>What are the deliverables?</h3>
      <p>We provide you with a personalized online gallery of high-resolution digital images from your special
        day. Cinematic trailer and cinematic highlight film form part of our main deliverables. </p>

      <h3>When can you expect the delivery?</h3>
      <p>It usually takes us 3-4 months to deliver your complete film.</p>

      <h3>Are we ok if you hire additional videographers?</h3>
      <p>No we are not. We try to keep our compositions clean by avoiding distractions and people carrying cameras
        are a distraction. We work very closely within our team to ensure we
        do not obstruct each other's frames and for this very reason we work in exclusivity. </p>

      <h3>How big is our team? </h3>
      <p>The size of the team is decided based on individual requirements.</p>

      <h3>Your wedding is next year, is it too early to enquire ?</h3>
      <p>It is never too early to enquire as we are usually booked months in advance.</p>

      <h3>What are your payment terms?</h3>
      <p>We take 20% of the total booking amount at the time of booking, the remaining balance is due on the
        first day of coverage.</p>

      <h3>Do we offer prints and/or wedding albums?</h3>
      <p>We offer a variety of professional print products including custom heirloom wedding albums.</p>
